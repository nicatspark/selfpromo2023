Instead of you doing the hard labour of comming up with the perfect midjourney prompt, why not let ChatGPT do the hard work for you?

Tell Midjourney:

```plaintext
Here is a MidJourney Prompt Formula:
A detailed image of [subject] [doing something interesting] during [time of day], taken with a [type of camera], using [type of lens] with cinematic lighting --v 5 --ar 16:9

Do you understand the formula?
```

It will go "yes master" and then you write for example:

```plaintext
Create a prompt with the above formula with the subject of a rowing boat.
```

And off you go on your ai art carreer.
