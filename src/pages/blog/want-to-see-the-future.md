Want to see the future? Try [Chromestatus](https://chromestatus.com/features)

Many interesting proposals are published here. And also information on some old ones too. I believe [HTML module proposal](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4854408103854080) is the same thing as HTML imports that I thought was done and burried. Turns out there is a something twitching at least. It's not much but still a hope that it may come alive at some point.
