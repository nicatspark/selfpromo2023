#### What is Map

Map is a collection of key and value pairs, similar to Object. The main difference between a Map and an Object is that Map allows key on any type either primitive or an object.

Letâ€™s learn how to create a Map and do operations on it.

#### Creating a Map

You can create a Map by using the new keyword

```js
let map = new Map();
This will create an empty Map.

Add a new element to Map
To set a key with the value we use map.set(key, value)

map.set("1", "my key is a string");
map.set(1, "my key is a Number");
map.set(true, "my key is a boolean");
```

Map allows keys with different datatype rather than converting them to string. So, in the above example, "1" and 1 are two distinct keys.

We can also use objects as keys in Map.

```js
let myObj = {name: "John Doe"};
map.set(myObj, "my value");
Access an element in a Map
To get the value, we use map.get(key) method.

//output: "my key is a string"
console.log(map.get("1"));

//output: my key is a Number
console.log(map.get(1));
```

We can also create a map from a nested array.

```js
const arr = [
  ['one', 1],
  ['two', 2],
]
Object.fromEntries(arr) // an object
new Map(arr) // a map
```

We should not access Map using object syntax: `map[key]`. This will make Map behave similar to a javascript object with all the limitations of an object.

#### Convert a Map to Object

To convert a Map to an object, we can use the `Object.fromEntries()` method, passing the Map as an argument. For example:

```js
const map = new Map([
  ['user1', 'John'],
  ['user2', 'Kate'],
  ['user3', 'Peter'],
])

const obj = Object.fromEntries(map)

// { user1: 'John', user2: 'Kate', user3: 'Peter' }
console.log(obj)
```

Note: `Object.fromEntries()` can transform any list of key-value pairs into an object. For example, it can directly transform the array of key-value pairs that we passed to the Map() constructor:

```js
const arr = [
  ['user1', 'John'],
  ['user2', 'Kate'],
  ['user3', 'Peter'],
]
const obj = Object.fromEntries(arr)

// { user1: 'John', user2: 'Kate', user3: 'Peter' }
console.log(obj)
```

#### Remove a key-value pair in Map

To delete a key-value pair from a Map we use `map.delete(key)`.

```js
map.delete(true)
Remove all key-value pairs from Map
To remove all key-value pairs from Map we use map.clear()

map.clear()
Count number of elements in a Map
```

To count the number of elements in Map we use `map.size`

```js
let map = new Map();
map.set(1, "one");
map.set(2, "two");

//output: 2
console.log(map.size)
Check if a key exists in a Map
To check if a key-value pair exists in Map we use map.has(key)

//output: true
map.has (1);
```

In this article, we learned what is Map and basic operations that we can perform on Map. In the next article, we will learn how to iterate over Map and convert it to array and object and vice versa.

#### Iterating a Map

For iterating over a Map, we can use the following javascript constructs:

- for..of
- forEach()

Let's create a Map first to loop over from the knowledge gained in our previous article.

```js
let map = new Map()

map.set("one", "first element");
map.set("two", "second element");
map.set(3, "third element");
Iterating map with for..of
We can use for..of to iterate a Map in Javascript.

for (let [key, value] of map) {
console.log(key + " = " + value);
}

//output
// one = first element
// two = second element
// 3 = third element
```

Map also provides these three methods, which comes in handy while iterating over a Map.

```js
map.keys() - Returns an iterable for keys
map.values() - Returns an iterable for values
map.entries() - Returns an iterable of key,value
for (let key of map.keys()) {
  console.log(key);
}

// output
// one
// two
// 3

for (let value of map.values()) {
  console.log(value);
}

// output
// first element
// second element
// third element

for (let [key, value] of  map.entries()) {
  console.log(key + " = " + value)
}

//output
// one = first element
// two = second element
// 3 = third element
```

#### Iterating Map with forEach()

We can also iterate through a Map using `forEach()`.

```js
map.forEach(function (value, key) {
  console.log(key + ' = ' + value)
})

//output
// one = first element
// two = second element
// 3 = third element
```

Map preserves the order in which values are inserted. So, while iterating over a Map, elements will be in the same order in which they are inserted.

#### Iteration over a Map in summary

To iterate over a Map, we can use for..of and `forEach()` loop constructs.
Map provides three methods that return iterable: `map.keys()`, `map.values()` and `map.entries()`.
Iteration over Maps is always in insertion order.

#### How do I type a Map in typescript?

```typescript
const colors: ReadonlyMap<TagProps['feColor'], TagColors> = new Map([
  ['blue',{bg:'azurblue',accent:'yellow'}],
  [...]
]}
```

#### So when should I prefer a map over an object?

A JavaScript Map is preferred over an object when:

- The keys are unknown or dynamic: If the keys of your data structure are not known or might change dynamically during runtime, then using a Map is a better option than using an object.
- Keys can be any data type: Maps can have keys of any data type, whereas objects can only have keys that are strings or symbols. If your use case requires keys of different data types, then a Map would be the better option.
- Iteration is required: Maps have built-in iterator methods that make it easier to iterate over their keys and values. If you need to iterate over the keys or values of your data structure, then a Map is a better option than an object.
- Performance is not a concern: In general, Maps are slightly slower than objects when it comes to accessing and setting values. If performance is critical to your application, then you might want to use an object instead of a Map.
- Maintaining insertion order: If you need to maintain the insertion order of your data structure, then a Map is a better option than an object. Maps maintain the order in which elements were added, whereas the order of keys in an object is not guaranteed.

In summary, Maps are preferred over objects when the keys are unknown or dynamic, can be any data type, iteration is required, insertion order needs to be maintained, and performance is not a critical concern.
