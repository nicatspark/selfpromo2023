### You may not need a bundler

"I have seen a couple threads on twitter where people complain about the difficulty with publishing NPM libraries or ask what starter kit they should use (or, people recommended starter packs anyways)
Example threads: [here](https://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1513903035197526017) [here](https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1510006191296061441) [here](https://twitter.com/iansu/status/1524860613943382017) [and here](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1525075901905522691)
One thing that is notable to me in these threads is that people often recommend that you use a bundler (a program that combines multiple src files into a single or fewer output files) when developing a library"

### How to publish your typescript repo to npm

From the begining.

- Name your package to the name that will be used on NPM. If your name is not original enough or you just want to group your uploaded packages over time add a namespace `@myNamespace/[package name here]`
- Add a license (MIT)
- Add typescript as a dev dependency `pnpm add -D typescript`
- Add a index.ts file
- Run `pnpm tsc --init`
- To tighten up some rules and use typescript as a linter, in tsconfig.json add
  `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true","noEmit": "true"`
- Run `git init`
- Add `node_modules/` and `dist/` to the git ignore file
- Add tsup with `pnpm add -D tsup` which bundles your files for you, turning typescript files into js files.
- In package.json / scripts add `"build": "tsup src/index.ts --format cjs,esm --dts"` ('cjs' if you want common-js support)
- test run with `pnpm run build`
- In package.json add `"main": "dist/index.js", "module": "dist/index.mjs", "types": "dist/index.d.ts"`,
- Add a lint script in `"scripts": { ... "lint": "tsc", ...}`
- To make versioning easier add chsangesets cli: `pnpm add -D @changesets/cli`
- Run `pnpm changeset init`
- It wil add a folder called changesets
- Add an initial version number to your package in package.json.
- Every time you want add a change you could add a changeset through `pnpm changeset` wich creates a markdown file that describes what change you've done. When you publish later it will merge those into a full changeset.
- Create a login at [https://npmjs.org](npmjs.org) and login with `npm login`
- publish with `npm publish --access public`

This is part one. Next I'll update with added github action worklflow. Soon, stay put.

### How to Create a Scoped NPM Package

To create a scoped package, first navigate to the root of your package directory.

Then, run the npm init command and pass your username as the value to the scope flag:

`npm init --scope=@your-username`

Respond to the prompts to create a package.json file. For your package name, the format should be @your-username/package-name.

For example @foundit/broadcaster.

You can now add the code for your package and test it. The process is the same as already explained above.
