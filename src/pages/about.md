For 25 years, I have always considered myself a designer above all else. However, upon reflection, I realize that my extensive experience with web projects means I am more accurately a developer first. Over the course of my career, I have witnessed numerous projects and companies thrive and others falter. Through these experiences, I have learned valuable lessons that I am now able to offer as advice to others. Some of my recommendations I know for sure have saved my client millions and cut short time to production by at least a year.
