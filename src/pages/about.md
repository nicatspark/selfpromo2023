With decades of experience in the industry, I am a seasoned full stack developer with a focus on frontend and user experience. My entry point into software engineering is from the UX angle as I started out as a print designer.

Since 1997, I have been working in the web development industry, creating web sites, apps, kiosk applications, intranet, CMSes, and working with user experience. I use tools such as Figma and Adobe XD to create prototypes. I believe that my involvement in UX allows me to have a enhanced holistic view of the project, goals and a better understanding of the needs of the client's customer.

On the backend, I have mainly worked with SQL databases such as MsSQL and MariaDB. I am proficient in a React/Typescript environment, native web components, and sometimes use meta frameworks such as Astro or Next but also curious about the newer smaller frameworks as Svelte, Solid, etc.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in both large teams for big companies, and also taking on complete projects for smaller companies. I am a strong believer in the importance of knowledge sharing and code reviews, and I enjoy getting feedback on my code to continuously improve my skills.

Overall, I think my experience and passion for web development make me a valuable asset to any team.
