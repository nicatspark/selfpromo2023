With 20 years of experience in the industry, I am a seasoned full stack developer with a focus on frontend and user experience. My career began as a graphic designer in 1990, where I honed my skills in advertising, brand identities, logotypes, and magazine design for both advertising agencies and individual clients.

Since 1997, I have been working in the web development industry, creating web sites and web apps, and working with user experience. I use tools such as Figma and Adobe XD to create prototypes, and I believe that my involvement in UX allows me to have a holistic view of projects, better understanding the needs of the client's customer.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in both large teams for big companies, using frameworks such as SAFe, and also taking on complete projects for smaller companies. I am a strong believer in the importance of knowledge sharing and code reviews, and I enjoy getting feedback on my code to continue to improve my skills.

Even though my focus is mainly on the frontend, I still have a passion for being involved in UX and believe that this gives me an advantage as my technological knowledge allows me to see solutions others may have missed. On the backend, I have mainly worked with SQL databases such as MsSQL and MariaDB. I am proficient in a React/Typescript environment, native web components, and sometimes use meta frameworks such as Astro or Next. I am also open to working on bigger projects using Svelte or other frameworks as long as they are up to date and fit for the task at hand.

Overall, my experience and passion for web development make me a valuable asset to any team.
